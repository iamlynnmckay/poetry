Move but for ought, \
To fill a certain silence \
That fills itself \
If left alone \
To fester. \
\
Static ooze, \
High frequency hum \
And color: \
Without names, \
Without stasis. \
\
Mind like salt on a leech, \
Mind like The Shark \
Made plush; \
Swimming faster though like and share \
Than in the sea - \
But I digress... \
\
A focussed distress. \
Gives to loss of purpose, \
Thus I undress - \
I can't be nervous \
Infront of such eyes \
That see not me, \
But a certain image \
That halts itself, \
If left alone. \
To disintegrate. \
\
Acrylics she welds like claws \
Peirce the peach skin, \
A sticky sweet thin film \
That drips \
Like holy meat sin unfit \
To lick a finger, \
Another, \
And then once more again - \
\
Canines in droves devour \
A matted hair clad flesh, \
A fruit's blood chin drips \
Down grin curve \
Clings \
To thin nerved \
Skin \
Past a lip licked \
To burst - \
As drops - \ 
To spatter \
Upon an marble, \
And she likes it.
