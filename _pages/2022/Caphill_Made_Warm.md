title: Caphill Made Warm
---

Caphill each day I listen as \
You shake a tremble-quiver \
On the edge of ecstacy tears and frightened laugher \
Song of ambulance wails \
Of screaming madmen and woo girls in the night \
Jazz horn acompanyments that jostle \
Without solo \
From traffic lit intersections \
Rage'd bird flippers \
Unleaded belching, wheezing geezer \
Pop-pop, groan, backfire shot, \
Pump our engines \
Conductor in seizure \
Arms knotted in sweat and spittol \
Out of phase, syncopated beyond all music, \
Raise up, up, above your head and mine, then \
\
Down, \
Short circuit, \
Halt, \
Still but not dead, \
Inhale, not breathing, then \
Sigh to darkness. \
We wait. \
White falls glorious in the night. \
Two lovers sleep for hours long as unlucky floors, \
We wait, then \
Dawn blooms like a silent mystery \
Today sky mother sees you my hill, \
From behind wraps you \
In foil blanket, \
Sing now a new lyric

Of salt scrapers \
Dogs unbarked with tiny shoes \
Boot crunch percussions \
Fall dead, absorbed \
SUV made ballerinas, \
Tread sweet softness, \
Gingerly bread not for such cloaked roads \
A kingdom without subjects \
A void abundant, full overflowing \
Ten queens on high crow from the skeletons \
Of trees who watch streets rendered queenless, no \
Fishnet mini skirt walkers dare tread \
While fingers becoming \
Purple clutch \
Photographs to send \
O'er the sea \
Each flake clothes you \
Makes you naked \
This land \
My land \
You are my birthright \
As are you for all others \
Who know what it is \
To love like this \
Your soul come alive \
By the freeze and the cold \
For such is truth \
Is nature.
