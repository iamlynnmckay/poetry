Men like snacks, turn. \
I like clown in the image of the mirror \
To me, hence truth, to mine \
Eye - \
Stand ground. \
\
Grandmother spoke of lions, \
Of New York city, \
Of horses, \
Then walls, \
Then ovens, \
Then hollow (men) -- \
Damn you and your echo. \
\
Your father boiled shit \
From memories of tuberculosis. \
You sold him tobacco, extracted \
Of forgotten bedtime cigarettes \
Stashed beneath his pillow. \
You may have been a nurse \
Lest daddy and his germs. \
\
I wear papyrus on Wednesdays; \
A skin smoothed by \
Needle ejaculate, \
A pill to stop the puss filling up the pores \
By chance \
Quells T infection. \
\
Men like cactus, grin. \
Smiles are that which cut - \
Else because they see through \
(The clock, the twitch, of seconds, that ticks, that really ticks me off and -) \
Else because they fear I am bizarre \
(No, I am cathedral). \
\
Fascism. \
\
He is not \
A wig of blonde, \
Tarnished \
In grease bath, \
And old blood, \
Blood that turns orange; \
He is an antichrist of the masses \
Yet to rise. \
\
The world is a bomb made of time \
With throne crowded by an aristocracy \
Of labor. \
Legs that buckle at the knees, \
Legs of straw. \
\
Do only as you have but no choice not to. \
Be of only masses, \
Of soup and bread, \
Do not lead. \
\
Only follow. \
Only lead by only follow.
