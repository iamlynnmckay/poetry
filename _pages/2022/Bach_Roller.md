## I: You Know Funhouse Right
\
TV's always on  \
In the corner \
Of El Coraz√≥n, \
For the universal husband \
For which the once busk band \
Made to stage stand  \
Holds no fury: \
Why? \
\
Shh! \
Sportsballson. 

## II: Union Pl. 
\
System normal, \
Utilitech fan, \
20:16:15 03/19/2022 \
A Saturday nest \
In a place called Union, \
Where the race each Friday  \
Drags on the weekend \
While 'tis the season - \
Oh she does love fracking  \
So (and she says call me he, ha). \
\
Assorted candy men parade \
The standard lisp,  \
A certain kind of beautiful; \
I (too) \
Once was of your lick, \
A \
Lost girl, vampire of gin and tonic, \
With a skeleton that sought \
To push and push, \
To blow through skin, \
In some crazy new dualism; \
Ego as the meat sack, \
Truth in bag of bones. \
\
Dry  \
Like rust on barbed wire, \
Like browe'd blades  \
Of starving grass, \
Like lips  \
That crack \
A smile \
To blood, to \
Drip, \
To mix now a \
Red tonic tonal \
Sent her \
\
Sense in lies, \
Sense in unself, only \
"I am not being, I *simply am*" \
"Excuse me can I see some" \
Aggressive un ID and \
\
Living? \
Maybe. \
Shift end. \
Clock out. \
Stare at the wall.  \
\
Please Nurse Alma, I am but \
Seeking ingenting, \
Let me in let me in let me in, for \
I cannot leave this house, \
It is assigned, for \
The sorting is inherent, immutable.
