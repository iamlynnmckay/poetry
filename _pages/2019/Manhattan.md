## I
\
One gentleman plays grand piano \
Under the Washington Arch \
While a homeless unit sleeps below \
Where an only sign of life \
Is hidden in the blankets \
The need for warm persists while \
\
The lady sells buttons, \
That call for the resistance; \
To rise up, \
To tourists, \
To press into their hearts \
To feel a part \
Of matter. \
\
Elis, mine island, \
The front door of homo-contemporerus; \
I have stood in the halls where the American was born \
British/Gernman/French, supervised, inspected, approved for boarding, \
By the childrens children their fathers fathers once traded \
Like baseball cards; \
A place of 2% hope and 98% tears. \
\
And oh green mortal gaurd, \
Bless thine torch, \
Might, \
And history, \
To stand as such makes \
A woman of stature enough for me. \
\
Elis, \
I am you, \
You are me, \
We are all, \
We be me. \
\
And I have walked up and down that 5th, \
Avenue of the Americas -- \
No map, no guide, no ride, no telephone; \
Where the streets maraude by compass points, \
And numerals, a symbiosis, an ecology of system, \
That strangers can understand. \
\
Where nature is construct and \
Society the natural order. \
\
Psychic basements dressed like sex shops \
Seep sweet neon purple out into the streets \
To join the flow. \
The dogless gather in droves at the \
Fences of the dog park with \
Cameras to prove the mutation of wolf \
Can be trained to obey \
Will love the same as us \
As we are so too \
Animal. \
\
Roller skater gentlemen join taxis in the dance, \
The traffic light choreographer drowned screaming \
By jay walk and ignore. \
\
I do not feel, \
I do, \
I do feel, \
I undo. \
\
The showman, the crooner, \
The Empire State up Broadway, \
Bursts the nocturne, \
Plume romantic, \
Singing silent sunshine. \
\
Any who for sufficiently long, \
Plays an act \
(Either to themselves or in public) \
Ceases to be an actor, \
This is law, \
This is what it means to take. \
\
And I feel them now in Greenwich village, \
The masters who beat their tempo in this very street, \
Whose timbre is this very air. \
\
A man I could love - \
Too many obsessed in \
A cabaret of femininity, fabulous, \
Like the jock out \
To prove his cock \
With red plastic cups, \
And beer pong \
It is the same. \
\
It is not cynicism, \
It is what I can measure. \
\
The capital takes its toll \
On all of us \
Two marks earth \
Scribe a gospel \
Neither true, though, \
Neither lies in whole. \
\
I am the dawn, \
Thirsty is the flood. \
\
And this is a human habitat.

# II 
\
I chose to stay another week, \
For promises made by house deities, \
Amongst the haze of flow of \
Richness and red wine, of dreams of \
Princeton, Stanford - \
Schools of ivy and the ancients \
And as I dined with that age beguiled one, \
He told me of a time before the small gods were born \
When his mother Jew, questionsed by the Holocaust, \
Lied about her age to save her life. \
\
A smile -- \
"My dog shits in Central Park" -- \
None loves a God like a God image. \
\
Took the Amtrack, \
Down to New Jersey, \
To see the town, \
Of the trinity of our age; \
Left the metropolis \
Of the school of kings \
To be a prince. \
\
I was crowned the Emporer on that stage, \
The precipice I had looked up at as \
An awestruck child, \
Hatching dreams in Rainbow Rooms, \
I knew one day I would return. \
\
I hope my childern \
Will remember the whales \
When it comes time \
To tell their children \
What it was like \
Before the plastic came, please \
\
Do not disturb me, else \
I will disturb you. \
\
Morning flight, \
Now I have loved you Manhatten \
There is no honour in goodness \
I feel it now \
The possibility to be a great woman, \
I have been wrong now for a while -- \
Life is not a story \
But a poem. \
\
New York I love you, but \
New York I cannot live you \
For all your Genesis, \
Apartment gardens \
Midtown parks \
And the almighty sun shafting streets \
A-slice splitting the avenues \
I am a mad dog \
Of ochre and eucalypt \
Of an untamable land \
And there is nothing wild here.
