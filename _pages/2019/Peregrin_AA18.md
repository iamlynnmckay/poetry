## I
\
Rise great falcon, \
By the heat-plume of bitumen lofts, \
Ride the updraft \
Against lines of scrapers of sky \
State empire, dharma capital, air city, \
Kingdom. \
\
To the apex.  \
Hands met, a-clasp, poised to pray \
To prey 'pon prey, picked and positioned -- \
A blink, \
Now down \
And screaming \
Shrieking whistle, sole soul chorus, \
The dive, \
Asymmetric \
Impact. \
\
Smoke, \
Mirrors, \
Origami and \
A twin pidgeon \
Returns \
To dust.

## II 
\
Wearing the exoskeleton of a pale elephant, \
The shepard of Central Park \
Cradles seed in papyrus hands \
"Come hither the flock \
Of old man time!", \
Teeth so spent on falsehood \
To have themselved turned the same way \
While an adhesive of saliva holds to gums; \
He still feeds the pidgeons and \
Still wonders what happened \
That September morning.
