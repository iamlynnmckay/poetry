Come one, come all, \
Ladies and gentlemen \
For democracy's dictation \
Of taxation, inflation, \
Legislation, regulation, creation \
Of jobs and growth, creation \
Of the mutation generation, \
The wave of elation, \
Be pure, be vibration, \
The sensation of fear evacuation \
Sweeping the nation \
The loss of family relation, \
Of position, of station, \
Of scriptures conflagration to cremation \
To build foundation \
For the new revelation \
To which to offer rumination by meditation, \
Oblation by obligation of donation, \
Ovation by oration \
Of doctrines quotation, stood in \
As narration's summation \
To cure the fixation for salvation \
From damnation \
In that final sedation \
To call it mere political masturbation \
Is floccinaucinihilipilification. \
\
Here, compassion is weilded like a battleaxe \
By hyperbole by label, \
"A party of hate". \
\
French bougy vs proles \
All started it, street swarm creatures \
Of darts and spit and I hope \
They are not \
Much dumber than me. \
\
Plausible hypothesis, \
Patholagise your friends, \
Correlate, assume cause, \
Derive claim - \
For by this chart, \
We disagree, you see, you and me, \
Though divided? \
No - \
In one thing, we agree, \
Pauline Hansen is a fucking dog cunt.
