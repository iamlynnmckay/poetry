## Wednesday
\
You are free to go (home) - \
Here you are either doing fine, \
Or diagnosed. \
\
Alice has never had psychosis \
Only the kind of crazy \
That earns comfort at parties \
Understood by sympathy, but \
Too special for empathy \
The kind they can come near \
To understand thorugh \
Zoo-pane glass, forged from \
Sand of archetype \
A husk with no grain and \
I am tired now \
Come back tomorrow. \
\
Better to do it in the bathtub, \
It would be rude \
To leave the carpet stained so \
And crimson would not match \
The room in any case \
Suit of pure air and goosebumps \
I am more comfortable lying down \
Do not blunt the good knives \
With such unwholesome game. \
For not a creature in this world \
Can believe that they will die.

## Tuesday 
\
I am it. \
I am the hallowed corpse. \
The dead in the mirror: \
Terror and hartred \
Are one and the same - \
See it in the eyes. \
Rape me o' centaur. \
\
I am fighting a mould \
That grows in my brain \
Binds me with ropes unmeasured, \
Fog and static, \
Visual snow, \
The urge to eat glass. \
\
In the shadow moment \
I am lucid, and \
While I am awake \
God damn it, I will move. \
\
Alice knows too much now. \
Alice can not know about us - \
It will kill you. \
Talking makes it real, \
You can kill what is real. \
\
My wrists itch \
Keeping you in.
