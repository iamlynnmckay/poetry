# Spelt From Demeter

Amen, in nest; mantis hysteria; fog machine; phallic chilli. \
\
Battle cry basis for conflagrated \
Monks faces conflated to conflict as feul \
And peace has nothing to do with war.  \
\
Bush pig Arab a rape  \
A come of oil a  \
Natural nature of observables, \
Deplorables, employables, phile-a-philes, \
Parakeets, tesseracts, banjos,  \
Hyeenas, the helpless, \
The named and the unnamed, \
The torment and ecstacy and all that \
Is holy and \
Is unholy and \
Is \
Us. \
\
The end is when  \
We all get to die \
The end is made of something better \
And if better is better and  \
If better speaks that better  \
We die  \
Than shall I surrender  \
My bones \
Or fight \
Like an animal. \
\
Like \
An animal.  \
\
Like  \
An \
Animal.  \
\
Like an animal.  \
\
Like an animal am I.  \
\
Shall I fight with my bones to be beaten? \
What of my tendons, muscles --  \
Sinew 'bout sinew 'bout sinew -- \
My obsession  \
With my body  \
As it exists \
In the mind \
Of others.  \
\
Pathetic.  \
Pathetic is laughing.  \
Is laughing pathetic? \
Laughing is pathetic.  \
Laughing pathetic is \
Pathetic laughing \
And is pathetic.  \
\
Cola man a year again  \
The kids again believe a  \
Gawd of plastic  \
Injection moulded perfection \
Sculptures of orient \
Massively made.  \
\
Insanity is doubt. \
Sanity is confidence. \
Market is morality. \
Customer is love.
