How many are we \
Inside of me? \
The panic ball, \
Tight and bound; \
Then the storm, the amarda of self, \
How resolute my conviction, \
And how quick I am to turn \
Upon my own, \
Like a top, a child's moment power turns \
Like the earth spun about its seasons. \
I am either numb -- \
Nimble and wide-eyed -- \
Or so saturated with humanity \
To be as lead to move, \
I will, I will, \
A promise sealed in glass carbon, \
My grandeur of beleif in the nobility, \
Of a kind of being that is said makes a good man: \
My bible, my quaran, my shrine in wonderland, my television news.
