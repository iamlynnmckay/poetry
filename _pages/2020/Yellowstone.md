# Yellowstone

Yellowstone, you are a zoo; \
I want to know your parts, \
As I see, there are two: \
A rock that farts for Americorn pride - \
We love you for being on time! \
Scheduled nature, \
Where elk feed on grass too green, \
Where one can tresspass in nowhere, \
That is one side of your story. \
The union is populated, \
Is constructed, \
And construct judged, \
Construct condemned and affirmed. \
Reality is the accident \
That which between plans holds time. \
Yellowstone, you are too easy, \
Too plentiful in the ingredients of heaven \
I want to know you as a lover knows a fingernail drawn across the back; \
I want your terror, I want your awe and pleasure. \
\
Backcountry, one day, by will, I am to \
Come back country seeing \
And learn to be that which holds no word \
Emotion, butnot by name, as sensation, \
That which is to be of you - \
Lost, and without people, with people.
