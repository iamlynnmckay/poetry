Smoke days, they came \
Of bush, a blaze \
Of end-day haze, to Sydney come \
To red the sun, to dim the \
Eye, choke horizons, smoked, \
Like hills, rolling; \
And a density, to dull the \
Ear, a hundred \
Undone hums -- lost, swallowed. \
We draw black leaf \
From the ground, \
Watch ash rain \
In the air, \
As about the land is burning - \
And the PM's in Hawaii.
