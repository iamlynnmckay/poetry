## I. Attack
\
Hark the loophole, giggle my love; \
We cheated a day with delays that \
Messed up all the plans -- bouncing, \
Never more grateful have I been. \
I hoped all crazy-like minded; \
That our taxi crashed (pain yes, but unfatal), \
Or freak storms would turbulatize, \
Or by some act of mad and power \
I and I alone could ground the planes. \
\
No, no, \
Time won. \
\
I sat at the airport bar \
With the window that faces \
Those who pass the security checkpoint \
To chance another look at -- \
A red jacket, \
Jolt awake, \
It is not you, \
You do not come by here, \
So I stay, \
And let it happen for many agains, \
Until I cannot bear. \
\
We have known the glass wall, \
We will know it again, as we \
Push our faces up to \
Screens to be closer, \
Whose other side is \
On the other side of the world. \
\
Like the time we saw the cassowary \
At the zoo \
I will pace in circles, blunted, \
Until the glass is gone, \
Replaced by atmosphere, \
Dissolved by those machines I so detest -- \
Who took you, \
Who will too take me back. \
\
I cannot write this. \
This is not my kind. \
I am this.

## II. Defense
\
I was afraid of it. \
I thought I had cut out that growth, \
Removed that organ; \
Love is a chemical illusion! \
Evolution's mechanism \
To make the pigs breed, \
It would not touch me, \
I would be above \
And smile and know better -- \
The humans all are children, \
A life I would devote to serve my isms, \
A price tag marked "lonely" seemed a smart deal to me. \
\
A happy wrong, \
To laugh at a man of mind so small; \
No, no, \
I won. \
\
I will be your eternal cartographer, \
I will map each inch of skin and hair, \
I will survey every tooth, every nail; \
For every part is holy, \
For every moment sacred, \
And as time's march will \
Fold your skin, \
Grey your hair, \
Curve your spine, \
I will still be mapping with these same fingers changed so too \
Until the days we have are ending, \
And the exploration at a rest, then \
Bring yours here, \
For the weave, the intertwine, \
As we hold our basket of hands, \
And together go away. \
\
I have done this many times, \
Oh airport, to leave I know like breath, \
Yet being left I know not breathing; \
Little bird is used to flying, \
But today it is space dog \
Who flies away. \
\
I can not stop crying. \
I can not stop smiling. \
Equally.
