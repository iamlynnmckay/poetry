## I. Echo Chamber

Elementalary school, \
Gym class today, \
The kids come custom made. \
\
Hair, tattoos, piercings, \
Add-ons and upgrades, \
Shirts that say things \
Like "nothing"; \
Facial expressions -- \
Indignation, projection, assumption -- \
Over ninety-nine pre-programmed opinions, \
But with the same patented technology, \
The dependable quality of the  \
Universal adapter, one size fits all, \
Just choose your base, which arm to bear, \
Which would you like? \
The one with the left,  \
Or the one with the right  \
Hand? \
\
Line up! Game starts soon! \
We're playing internet today. \
Line up! Two rows, sit, cross legs,  \
Face your doppel. \
Okay, alright now, final touches.  \
Here comes the mirror!  \
Between, up down, and through the middle,  \
the 'ners, hide the other, there we go. \
Quiet! Quiet! \
Everyone, we're starting! \
Alright now, on three! \
I want you \
To scream into the mirror, yes, \
Scream into the mirror! \
Ready? \

## II. Holy War
\
Sex-eyed parrot. \
Hollow head. \
Makes mine ache. \
It resonates. \
Someone else's noise, \
In one ear, \
Out the mouth. \
Another ear. \
Another mouth. \
Volume over fidelity. \
The flock as one \
Screech to scripted  \
Chinese whispers. \
\
Think twice. \
Think double. \
Double think. \
\
I'm so - \
() \
I have to - \
(speak) \
I don't usually -  \
(speak up) \
I can't just - \
(speak the fuck up) \
\
Loot a Target. \
Sell the shit. \
Keep the money. \
Don't donate. \
Make a difference. \
\
Words are not violence. \
Words cause violence. \
But only violence is violence. \
\
Why should I care if you cry and yell? \
So can they. \
I care not because of what I feel, \
But because of what I know. \
What I see. \
Of what is real. \
Of real is only what is real. \
All truths are true truths. \
But only truths are true. \
What is real is only what is real. \
What is real is only what is real. \
What is real is only what is real.

## III. BLaMe
\
Black swans are beautiful. \
No! All swans are beautiful. \
\
All swans are beautiful. \
No! Black swans are beautiful. \
\
Sometimes pigs come,  \
Hungry. \
\
They hunt the swans,  \
All swans, \
For being swans. \
\
But black swans, \
They love to hunt \
For being black. \

## IV. Guil(lo)t(ine)
\
Learn to hate yourself better. \
A dollar spent on plastic fruits, \
Is a dollar stolen from the starving; \
It is the same. \
This is fact, thief. \
It is the same. \
Know you have an evil \
Beyond your comprehension. \
Self-love is self-acceptance, and \
Self-acceptance is repression, \
Targetedly so. \
You do this for you. \
You are angry because you are without excuse. \
There are billions of you. \
\
Lurker me, \
Like some surveyous vampire \
Through the traffic cameras, \
The mob a jigsaw, \
Pig-pens on wheels, re-aww odes, \
A blue a red a flashing, \
This way I walked each day, \
Now SWAT away, scatter Pike and 5th, \
Of ants, \
Now a-flame a-cop car, \
Now up the Pine, \
To the park of the first queer powers, \
To the East, to the weird and the gay, \
Down dunk the capitol pill, \
To the gas-flash, attrition, \
To Cuba once more. 

## VI. Chaz the Ironworker
\
Hold both the hot and the cold stone, \
But hold neither; \
Look at the white queen through the eyes of the black queen, \
Look at the black queen through the eyes of the white queen, \
It is okay to see the romance in the fall of a knight \
Dark in the city of rain if you know his construction \
Both in history and in the very real and very present sense \
Of a gunshot wound to the shoulder, \
Of physical pain, \
Of a flight blue-taped, mag-militant, \
Armed in the open met open-armed, calm, \
Like family, like family too much so; \
Which one, oh strange gangster, is your brother? \
Which one? \
\
Don't get distracted by these -- \
Love the anarchists for they -- \
No pictures, please -- \
Please livestream my friends because -- \
I didn't mean -- \
Well that's just not okay. \
