# Loss of Year

Hit me fucking \
Hit me fucking \
Hit me fucking \
Hollow point. \
\
Her skin turns funny colors, \
To scales that dry to flakes, \
That fall off all over, \
She dissapears. \
\
She thinks she wants to die, \
She sees the doctor all the time, and \
I have seen faces like yours \
In the people who are the mirrors, \
The people of the streets of \
San Francisco. \
\
Me told me I have been too busy, well, \
Try begs try, to try too much would lose me too; \
In all about what is right, \
Not what is good. \
