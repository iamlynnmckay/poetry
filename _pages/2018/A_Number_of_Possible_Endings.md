## I. Summer Fire Diamonds: Welcome to Rome
\
Oh medicine, cracked medicine,  \
Bottles and bottles of beer \
On the wall \
Of The Red Enemy -- television please, \
Love me -- new empire come \
To decimate the states, \
Prophets are we needing \
No dreams to see a wholesome \
Vlog martyr, biggest fan, spells of \
Hey guys, hey guys, \
I will teach you of a \
Sponsor. \
\
Paraphilia, stimulate my body, \
Stimulate my mind; with cataclysm, \
Empty stobing lights and \
Hollow sound and \
Wretched sickly colors I cannot name \
I overflow. \
\
Too calm, a sense of unknown danger, \
Mangy animal are pull each upon a limb \
For grander part of \
Phallic competition prize be granted \
By a wish that scares me most: \
To win and to have nothing \
To wish for.

## II. Autumn Wind Clubs: Mother on Bench
\
A large dark come to catch you \
As cradle snatcher come to patch you \
Kids for lark or dosh or rape, to \
Apply the mark of the park needle, \
Inject you then forget you; \
Throw fair souls to pits of fire, \
Pits of sand, where \
Cats piss and by great tiny hands, wrists -- \
Eyes and mines -- dunes from spring, \
And are swallowed; \
By time to go.

## III. Winter Water Spades: My Spirituality
\
Teeth, too many teeth, \
Too many teeth in children's \
Skulls of such quality and \
Quantity, oh teeth, how I \
Could use you all for \
So much more. \
\
Meth-spent mothers better \
For milking than society, \
Better for breeding, pumping, \
Truly better for the child \
And better for the whole. \
\
May the useless be reborn like cattle, \
Factory line, production, production, \
Spots appear, puss bulging, \
Tits suctioned by cups, \
Apply yourself, apply the pressure, \
Sweet stinking eruptions mark \
The passing of time, of if we \
Waste not too the meat of \
Stock too weak to stand \
We can be free of starvation, \
Free of endings, \
For none shall ever want again.

## IV. Spring Air Hearts: iAm
\
Nothing is bigger than the star beast \
And the star beast is bigger than it all. \
Nothing is bigger than the star beast \
And the star beast is bigger than it all. \
\
She plays the leper at parties, \
Clinging to the cauliflower brain \
They gave her to hold \
As comfort when she was small. \
\
We do not talk much anymore. \
But then, nor does anyone \
Since the day of the egg, \
When we all became the yolk \
And locked ourselves inside the shell \
To swim, always, to swim.
