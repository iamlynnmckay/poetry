## I
\
Lockheed, lockheed, \
We love you lockheed, \
Your darling arms races, \
Foreign bases making spaces \
Making places without traces \
Of the same five faces -- \
The same five faces \
I see all over and over again. \
\
Hot little fucks, sweet arses, street corners, \
No-toother, he'd be blooming with barnacles \
If he lived in the sea. \
\
Ne'er said a word, \
But the eyes, I can see, \
The old ape has gone off and \
Been kissing God again. \

## II
\
The game is a long one \
You can play it forever \
The game is in proving \
The humans are gone and \
You win whenever you \
Cannot remember \
You ever were playing \
At all. \
\
It is a loving, a deep loving, \
A loving indeed, of spreadsheets, \
Flowcharts, pornography, \
(How are you? \
I am well. \
And you? \
I am well too.) \
Of sign ins, sign ups, sign ons, \
Signs, spiritual signs, \
Signs only I can hear, \
Signs that speak only to me. \
\
And there is roadwork. \
Endless roadword. \
Be finished. \
One day.
