## I
\
Told us that this word was for us men, you see \
That woman is our right, you see \
But real men, I mean, you see -- not the kind you are \
The other kind, the one true kind, the pure kind, \
The kind that fucks like a heaving gorilla, \
Seeks not of you're shore, \
(Though) finds no pleasure in disgrace, \
Only asks of you your best, your very best, \
Do not speak, do not move, do not do anything at all, \
Until it's over, then and only then, \
Can you tell him of his greatness. \
\
Haggard scrufflers lurch by a dragging of the left foot, \
A stopp\'ed march of booz\'ed beings, \
Gnawing tiny cakes of ash, spilling dust from ears and nose and mouth, \
Street sweet substitute for spittoon tink, \
Dogs of squalitude, death flirters, starving, \
Milk bathed eyes, equal parts fear and logic \
And cruelty. \
\
Pink lace tyed box of strawberries lies for my darling hypocondriach -- \
Do not be afraid my dear, sometimes it is a tumor after all.

## II
\
Make of me the mad one, make of me the stone, \
The stone that marks your black land's end, \
The stone that marks your neighbours home, \
And talk only with me there, \
Raise up to hover poised, \
Then force yours and those so named apart  \
By names time nopes and makes a void.  \
\
Symbol seller came to sell a symbol sold it, \
Guy got it told the others got one too, \
Start fighting 'cause the symbols got too big, \
Ends up all on earths so symbol seller come, \
Pick up dry off dry out and sell again some more. \
\
She says we shouldn't be afraid, \
'Cause when all the aliens do come, \
They'll all get stuck in roundabouts \
And go round, \
And round, \
And round.
