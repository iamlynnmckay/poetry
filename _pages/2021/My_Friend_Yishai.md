# My Friend Yishai

## I
\
It happens not once, but over and over \
Not at one moment, but on a loop \
Not in one place, but at all places, in each \
Of us in who that life has touched our life \
\
It plays a game of pool inside a nightmare \
Starring you, the eight ball, what a role \
White out of nowhere strikes the first ball \
Who tells another and another and another \
And then you, speechless screaming, \
The floor is gone, \
And you are falling. \
\
But this is its beginning \
Again and again, the desprate filthy goblin \
Of memory pounces to confront \
Like the ocean beneath the glacier, \
Like the ice beneath the ocean, \
Like the earth beneath space. \
\
It is a parasite, \
A spectre that haunts \
From within.

\
Still the city beats its ripe and rot, \
Presses a grin 'pon pains of our mind windows, \
Damn near maddening; \
Pretending things are the same. \
There are only so many left \
Of the not today days. \
\
Think I'll sit. \
No I won't sit. \
Got to do. \
Something. \
Cup of coffee. \
Shit no creamer. \
Go the store. \
No too hard. \
Black coffee then. \
Too many cables. \
Cables all over the place. \
Up in my eyes. \
Someone could trip. \
Wires that swim. \
Worms in my brain. \
Someone could trip. \
Better tie them. \
Cable tie the cables try \
To have some sense of order \
I am terrified \
I tie the cables \
Swears and hours \
Spent on making coffee cold \
No, not good like that \
I don't like something \
Something is not ok \
Must be the cable ties \
I tried, I'm terrified \
Time I untie \
The cable ties \
To be ok \
To fix it \
Fix it \
Fix it.

\
What if for me \
Death has naught to do with god \
Nor fate, nor meant to be \
Nor for a reason \
No better place, no afterlife, \
No reward for good deed, \
Just \
\
No life \
Is supposed to make sense \
This the the creulest thing I know \
Let us be in greif and pain \
Let us not be strong \
Let us not be happy \
It is allowed. \
It is ok.

\
The death we cannot fight \
We do not fear, \
The death apart from life, \
The death we cannot know, \
Nor sincerely beleive. \
\
But the death we fear, \
Can be fought. \
The death that lies within our hearts, \
The thought of death inside our minds, \
For against the image of death \
We have great weapons \
Their names are \
Family \
Friends \
Memory \
Love \
And stories. \
\
The more we weild these \
The less they blunt, or fade, or falter.

## V
\
To live \
Compressing more goodness than most shed in a lifetime \
Into an unfair duration of time \
Uncompromising in an integrity unpollutable \
Breathing hydrocarbon gas, \
Turning it to wind, \
Of an honour, an honour in character, \
Not in cheap wealth, unearned statues, cheap disguises, \
But in honesty and compassion \
And of a wellspring mind \
That leapt and danced \
Through ideas like they were playthings, \
Like serious toys, \
Transformed sometime to action, \
By a boundless energy, \
A drive to *do*, to truly *do*, \
Or carved by tongue to worded sculptures \
In shapes of humor and delight. \
\
Would that we live but a fraction so well -- \
There is no line or stanza \
For the species of gratitude I have \
For knowing you \
I'm grateful the gift of knowing you, adminiring \
The person you are.

Been afraid of Facebook. \
\
Broke. \
\
Saw the posts. \
\
Photos. \
\
Hurt. \
\
Really really really hurt. \
\
Made me laugh and smile and cry. \

Goodbye my friend Yishai.
