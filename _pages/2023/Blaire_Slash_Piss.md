As phones are drones \
That hone on those that own \
Them -- \
You mean those they own? \
Yes -- \
Iraq was a mistake, \
Deliberately. What is written \
Is not an accident. \
A memo is written, as \
A gallows is carved. \
\
(shiver) \
\
Like piss on a hot rock, \
Fades like elephants, \
Fades like the next place in Seattle after 2am, \
Fades like a friend after 3 years estranged, \
Fades like a hairline, \
Such fade may be blessed. \
\
Fades like a shirt  \
Preferred with the choice of a cumshot; \
Relaxed and extravagant, \
Crusted, soft, \
Dim — \
And enlightened.  \
\
Laughing.

Where’s Kanye? \
Wouldn’t be surprised if he’s under a bridge Somewhere \
Piling dirt \
You know \
“This is my castle”.
